# Flans-API
This API is meant for an easy connection between Bukkit/Spigot plugins and Flans Mod, but it's still very experimental.

# How does it work?
You must add the API to your libraries to gain access to all methods. You must also upload the API onto your minecraft server as well as the client ("mods"-folder).
